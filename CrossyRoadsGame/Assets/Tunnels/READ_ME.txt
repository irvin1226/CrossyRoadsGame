BACK-FACE CULLING of Tunnels.

These back-face culling of the tunnels is intentional.

That is because when you come across a tunnel, you never get to see
the outside of it. I mean the outer wall of the tunnel. That is because
it is probably covered with Mountain, or some other enclosure.
I hope this helps you if you are confused.
